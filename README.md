# app-icons

Currently usng this to host some of the icons I am using in my email signature.

Some of the original images were sourced from https://hugeicons.com/. I went in and customized the SVGs to better match up with what I was looking for.

Initially tried to convert images and icons to base64 using https://www.base64-image.de/, but that didn't work with gmail.
